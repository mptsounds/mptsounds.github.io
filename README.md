# README: Documenting tecnical details of my blogging journey
*This is a work in progress.*

## Notes:
- For now, only published page is /docs/README.
- The goal's to make a proper multi-page blog where all published entries are in /docs.
- Try to utilise Command Prompt/Terminal as much as possible rather than relying on GitHub UI.
- All post headers should show a tag (e.g. Personal vs. Technical vs. Arts), plus subtags for hobbies (e.g. Ergo keyboards, audio, comic, game dev, film reflections etc.)
- Add basic protection from data scraping tools
- Consider hosting a separate page or subdomain for each seemingly "career-unrelated" hobby.

## How I set up this site (initially):
### First post:
- Created repository: mptsounds.github.io
- Added a /docs/README.md (this creates a subfolder named `docs` and README.md underneath it)
- In the repo, went to Settings >> Pages (see dropdown on the left) >> under Branch, choose /docs >> Save >> Check puplished blog which is https://mptsounds.github.io/

### Setting up a theme:
- Inside /docs folder, added _config.yml to define a theme (in this case `minima`)
- Chose a proper theme by browsing: https://jekyllthemes.io/free
